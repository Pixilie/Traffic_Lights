# Traffic Lights
## Introduction
**Traffic Lights** is a 2D game that draws inspiration from the popular game [Traffix](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102580/Traffix/). A friend and I developed this game using the Pygame library as a school IT project. The gameplay is straightforward, challenging players to manage traffic by controlling traffic lights. If you enjoy puzzle games that test your decision-making skills, give "Traffic Lights" a try.
